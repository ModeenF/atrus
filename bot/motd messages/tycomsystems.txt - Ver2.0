Welcome to the TyCom Systems BeShare Server...

There are some simple rules to follow:

 - DO NOT swear in the main channel, If you must do   so, do it privately.
 - Do not share offensive material (Racial material, Porn*, etc...)
 - Do not share any BeOS warez except for abadonware (It is simple, if
   you can buy it don't share it - Sharing of Private Betas such as BONE,
   OpenGL and Exp/Dano R5.1, PhOS etc are NOT allowed)** 
 - Mp3 audio, and Media such as DivX ;-) are allowed as long as it is not
   offensive.

* Porn is the vulgar depections of nudity and/or sex. What can be considered
   as Art is acceptable unless the host/Admin deems otherwise.

** Remember, anything you can't share here... BeOS comes with a built in ftp
     server.
