Welcome to the TyCom Systems BeShare Server...

There are some simple rules to follow:
 - DO NOT share Porn*
 - DO NOT share any BeOS warez
 - DO NOT swear in the main channel

 - Remember, anything you can't share here... BeOS comes with a built in ftp server.
 - Never hesitate to ask a question to anyone no matter how simple or dumb you think it is...
 - Download beshare:BeShare?Member?-?Templates*.zip and create your own BeShare file.
 * Porn is the vulgar depictions of nudity and/or sex.

Jess Tipton would like to thank all those who attempted to help solve his CDR problem. After a long day & too much frustration he did not walk away when he should have & wishes to appologise to any one he may have upset.
