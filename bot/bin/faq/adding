Q: 
How to add more FAQ questions?

A:
Use StyledEdit to make plain textfile than contains the question and its answer. Filename must be in
lowercase and there is no maximum size, although it is recommended that file is relatively small (1 - 2kb).
When file is finished send private message to me (Garjala) and I will download your file, check it and 
then add it to FAQ.
