Q:
How to patch BeOS R5 to run on Athlon systems?

A:
This should work:

1. Boot BeOS with patched bootdisk (available from BeShare)

2. Edit /boot/beos/system/kernel_intel.patch and replace "memcpy_pIII" with "memcpy_default"
   and "memset_pIII" with "memset_default"

3. Edit /boot/beos/system/lib/libroot.so.patch and replace "memcpy_pIII" with "memcpy_default"
    and "memset_pIII" with "memset_default"

And remember to backup those two files BEFORE you edit them. Now you should be ready to go.
