Q:
How do I fix the too much memory problem?

A:
1. Copy /boot/home/config/settings/kernel/drivers/sample/kernel to
  /boot/home/config/settings/kernel/drivers/kernel

2. Edit the new file and uncomment the disk_cache_size line by removing the # sign.

3. Change the 2048 to 16384 if you have more than 128MB of RAM.
