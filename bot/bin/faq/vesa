Q:
Why BeOS boots up with grayscale picture?

A:
Your display adapter is probably not supported by BeOS and it uses fail-safe driver. 
If your display adapter supports VESA 2.0 you can try this:
Go to /boot/home/config/setting/kernel/drivers/sample. There is a file named vesa. 
Open it and add one of the following two rows (not both of them):
mode 800 600 16
mode 1024 768 16
Save file. Copy vesa file to /boot/home/config/settings/kernel/drivers and boot BeOS. 
If you are lucky you get colors using VESA modes.

There is also a program Vesa Accepted, which can make same modification. It can be 
found from BeBits.
