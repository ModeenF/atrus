Q:
How to get 2+ USB joysticks working in BeOS?

A:
For every usb joystick attached, you get a device added, eg, if you have two usb joysticks... 
/boot/home/config/settings/joysticks/usb/0 and /boot/home/config/settings/joysticks/usb/1. 
If you return to the joysticks prefs, or want to use a particular one, BeOS gets confused. 

To correct this, open the device entry and edit it. Change the line that reads gadget 
= "Generic USB Joystick" to gadget = "Generic USB Joystick0" where 0 is the device number, 
or change it to something else unique.
